# standup

## This project is part of a Mongoose course on pluralsight and uses Node, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express for the application. 
## Also, the database is hosted on MongoLab. 

## The project has the following features:
* Allows the user to create new stand-up meeting notes
* Empty form error validation
* Ability to view all the recent notes that have been taken
* Filter notes by member name 

I have better understanding of Mongo and Mongoose because of this course and enjoyed building out the application.
